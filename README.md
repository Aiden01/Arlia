The Arlia compiler and libraries are not finished yet.

Read [documentation](https://github.com/vanaur/Arlia/blob/master/doc/readme.md)!

### Paradigmes:

 - Object-oriented ;
 - Has functional concepts ;
 - Handling exceptions ;
 - Uses templating ;
 - Uses type inference and is statically typed ;
 - [Using dependent types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type) ;
 - Is an [array language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming).
 
### Why use Arlia ?

Arlia is a general purpose language, whose primary characteristic is to program without worrying about problems, often meet in other languages :

 - Automatic and intelligent **memory management** ;
 - Better **loop** management ;
 - Better **array** management ;
 - Integrated **template** management ;
 - Readable and **pretty syntax** ;
 - No cost abstraction ;
 - Simple and **intuitive object creation** ;
 - Close to assembler but also very **high level** (much more important than in C-like) ;
 - Compile a **readable and reusable assembler code**, without DLL (except if necessary depending on the project) ;
 - Has a more **advanced object oriented definition** (= closer to the original) than most current OO languages.
 - Offers a variety of standard libraries ;
 - ...

Arlia is a non-C-like programming language, based on the object-oriented paradigm and offering functionalities from functional programming. Its role is to be a robust alternative to widely used programming languages.

### Standard libraries

For the moment, the libraries are not yet ready given the level of progress of the project, but they will plan:

 - A standard IO library ;
 - An OS based library ;
 - A GUI library ;
 - A media managing library ;
 - A library dedicated to the WEB, data bases and servers.

### For the future

The Arlia project plans for the future the design of several micro frameworks, as well as a compatible EDI.
Here is the list of the micro framework envisaged:

 - A 2D/3D game engine (with EDI) ;
 - A web conception framework (that will allow you to create WEB sites and applications) ;
 - A framework based on AI (deep learning / machine learning / neural network) ;
 - A framework based on 3D simulation and modelling.

## Arlia is in construction version [v0.01]
