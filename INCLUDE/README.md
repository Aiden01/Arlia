## Targeted assembler information
### The default INCLUDE folder is for Windows.

This folder, containing the target assembler's standard libraries (FASM), as well as its compiler,
come from the designer's site: https://flatassembler.net.

_____________________

These files are used by most standard language libraries.
Using SSSO (same source, same output) technology, only the FASM compiler changes, depending on the OS (Windows, Linux, Mac).

Download the compiler corresponding to your OS on the website of the assembler used.
