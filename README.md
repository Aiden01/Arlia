The Arlia compiler and libraries are not finished yet.

### Paradigmes:

 - Object-oriented sowing (not all notions are respected) ;
 - Semi functional (not all notions are respected) ;
 - Handling exceptions ;
 - Using implicit templateting and a few meta programming ;
 - Using type inference ;
 - [Using dependent types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type) ;
 - Is an [array language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming).
 
### Why use Arlia ?

Arlia is a general purpose language, whose primary characteristic is to program without worrying about problems, often meet in other languages :

 - Automatic and intelligent **memory management** ;
 - Choice of an intrinsic paradigm according to needs (mainly **purely functional** or **purely object-oriented**);
 - Better **loop** management ;
 - Better **array** management ;
 - Integrated template management ;
 - Readable and **pretty syntax** ;
 - No cost abstraction ;
 - Simple and **intuitive object creation** ;
 - Customizable language (properties can be modifie or added) ;
 - Close to assembler but also very **high level** (much more important than in C-like) ;
 - Compile a **readable and reusable assembler code**, without DLL (except if necessary depending on the project) ;
 - Has a **fast** but **efficient** compiler ;
 - Has a more **advanced object oriented definition** (= closer to the original) than most current OO languages.
 

One of the particularity of this language is simply **the whole that it is**. You are master to choose how to program, the language bends to all your desires. You want to do **pure functional programming** for the study of mathematical algorithms? Or use a **purely object-oriented environment** (very close to the original definition)? Or you just want to create a **stable, but simply robust program**? Arlia allows all this. Better yet, **these different paradigms are in perfect symbiosis**, and you can make the most of what they offer to design a powerful program, simply and efficiently.
Indeed, one of Arlia's goals is to propose an optimal development approach via these paradigms while remaining intuitive, and simple.

### Standard libraries

For the moment, the libraries are not yet ready given the level of progress of the project, but they will plan:

 - A standard library, easy to access and use ;
 - A library dedicated to file and folder management ;
 - A library of OS management ;
 - A graphic library ;
 - A media managing library ;
 - A library dedicated to the WEB and servers.

### For the future

The Arlia project plans for the future the design of several micro frameworks, as well as a compatible EDI.
Here is the list of the micro framework envisaged:

 - A 2D/3D game engine (with EDI) ;
 - A web conception framework (that will allow you to create WEB sites and applications) ;
 - A framework based on AI (deep learning / machine learning / neural network) ;
 - A framework based on 3D simulation and modelling.

## Arlia is in construction version [v0.01]
