The Arlia compiler and libraries are not finished yet.

Read [documentation](https://github.com/vanaur/Arlia/blob/master/doc/readme.md)!

### Paradigmes:

 - Object-oriented sowing (not all notions are respected) ;
 - (Events driven) ;
 - Semi functional (not all notions are respected) ;
 - Procedural ;
 - (Handling exceptions) ;
 - Using implicit templateting and a few meta programming ;
 - Using type inference.
 

### Why use Arlia ?

Arlia is a general purpose language, whose primary characteristic is to program without worrying about problems, often meet in other languages :

 - Memory management ;
 - Type conversion ;
 - Easy management of structured variables (arrays) ;
 - Better loop management ;
 - No cost abstraction ;
 - Readable and pretty syntax ;
 - Better template management ;
 - Simple object / type creation ;
 - Customizable language (properties can be modified: see examples "NumberProc.arl") ;
 - (Personalized exception system).

Any developer wanting a little rest, but without losing a drop of efficiency is made for the Arlia programming language.
And then, development requires a little touch of modernity, and developers to change a bit their ideas.

### Standard libraries

For the moment, the libraries are not yet ready given the level of progress of the project, but they will plan:

 - A standard library, easy to access and use ;
 - A library dedicated to file and folder management on the operating system ;
 - A graphic library ;
 - A media managing library ;
 - A library dedicated to the WEB.

### For the future

The Arlia project plans for the future the design of several micro frameworks, as well as a compatible EDI.
Here is the list of the micro framework envisaged:

 - A 2D/3D game engine (with EDI) ;
 - A web conception framework (with a other version of Arlia : ArliaScript (transpiled)) ;
 - An arduino / raspberry framework ;
 - A framework based on AI (deep learning / machine learning) ;
 - A framework based on simulation.

## Arlia is in construction version [v0.01]
