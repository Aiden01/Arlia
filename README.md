The Arlia compiler and libraries are not finished yet.

### Paradigmes:

 - Object-oriented sowing (not all notions are respected) ;
 - (Events driven) ;
 - Semi functional (not all notions are respected) ;
 - Procedural ;
 - (Handling exceptions) ;
 - Using implicit templateting and a few meta programming ;
 - Using type inference.
 
### Why use Arlia ?

Arlia is a general purpose language, whose primary characteristic is to program without worrying about problems, often meet in other languages :

 - Memory management ;
 - Type conversion ;
 - Easy management of structured variables (arrays) ;
 - Better loop management ;
 - No cost abstraction ;
 - Readable and pretty syntax ;
 - Better template management ;
 - Simple object / type creation ;
 - Customizable language (properties can be modified: see examples "NumberProc.arl") ;
 - (Personalized exception system).

One of the particularity of this language is simply the whole that it is. You are master to choose how to program, the language bends to all your desires. You want to do pure functional programming for the study of mathematical algorithms? Or use a purely object-oriented environment (very close to the original definition)? You may also want your program to react dynamically to events? Arlia allows all this. Better yet, these different paradigms are in perfect symbiosis, and you can make the most of what they offer to design a powerful program, simply and efficiently.
Indeed, one of Arlia's goals is to propose an optimal development approach via these paradigms.

### Standard libraries

For the moment, the libraries are not yet ready given the level of progress of the project, but they will plan:

 - A standard library, easy to access and use ;
 - A library dedicated to file and folder management on the operating system ;
 - A graphic library ;
 - A media managing library ;
 - A library dedicated to the WEB.

### For the future

The Arlia project plans for the future the design of several micro frameworks, as well as a compatible EDI.
Here is the list of the micro framework envisaged:

 - A 2D/3D game engine (with EDI) ;
 - A web conception framework (with a other version of Arlia : ArliaScript (transpiled)) ;
 - An arduino / raspberry framework ;
 - A framework based on AI (deep learning / machine learning) ;
 - A framework based on simulation.

## Arlia is in construction version [v0.01]
